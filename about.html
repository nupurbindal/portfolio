            <p class="intro">I’m a first year Masters in Information student at the University of Michigan with a focus on <br>
                Human-Computer Interaction. With an undergraduate degree in Math and an undying love for Art <br>
                and Design, I found my equilibrium in UX Design - a field that lets me explore the creative <br>
                within a technical realm. As a UX Designer, I’m committed to building accessible and inclusive <br>
                systems that are flexible and allow all members to feel welcome on a platform.</p>

                    <h2>Tea</h2>
                    <p class="tea"> My enthusiasm for tea is fairly recent. I had my first cup of green tea maybe  
                        3 years ago and the excitment hasn't faded since. I now make it a point to always have 
                        atleast 7 different varieties of tea on hand. Flavours count. Despite my affection for 
                        this well-loved beverage, I do not like my tea with milk.

                    <h2>Photography</h2>
                    <p class="photo"> I've been taking pictures since I in middle school. It started with an attempt  
                        to avoid being in front of the camera myself. Eventually, it developed into a 
                        passion that has grown with time. The biggest takeaway I've had from my experience 
                        as a photography, as cliche as it sounds, is that the best camera in the world is the 
                        one you have with you.
